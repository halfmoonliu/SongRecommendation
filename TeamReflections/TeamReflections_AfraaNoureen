## Teamwork Reflections on The Song Recommendation Application Project
                                                                               Afraa Noureen
                                                                               
Reflecting on our final project experience, there's a lot to appreciate in our teamwork. Everyone brought their A-game, fostering constant communication, and we effectively leveraged our diverse skill sets. However, a key observation is that we might have benefited from starting with a less complicated project. Starting with something simpler would have given us a smoother start and allowed more time to grasp the tools we were working with. Another takeaway is the need for a better balance between this extensive project and our other commitments. So, we held a group feedback session, which proved to be beneficial for all team members. This session allowed us to discuss both positive aspects and areas for improvement, fostering a constructive dialogue. Each team member played a substantial role in the project, contributing extensively to its success.
